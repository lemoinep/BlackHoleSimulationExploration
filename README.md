My objective is to explore various concepts in physics by formulating problems mathematically and conducting simulations.  
This approach will yield many interesting and valuable insights.

## Detailed Explanations of the Code and Scientific Concepts  

### Why This Simulation?  
The primary goal is to provide a simplified yet instructive visualization of gravitational collapse and black hole formation.  
While not capturing the full complexity of general relativity, it offers an accessible representation of fundamental principles:  

- **Gravitational Collapse**: Understand how matter concentration contracts under its own gravity, becoming increasingly dense.  
- **Black Hole Formation**: Observe how this contraction creates an object so dense that even light cannot escape.  
- **Event Horizon**: Visualize the boundary (event horizon) beyond which nothing can return.  
- **Accretion**: Approximately simulate how black holes attract and absorb surrounding matter.

### Key Concepts and Equations  

#### **Universal Gravitation (Newton)**  
- The simulation uses Newton's law to calculate gravitational forces between particles and the central mass (representing the forming black hole).  
- **Equation**:  
  $$
  F = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
  $$  
  where $F$ = force, $G$ = gravitational constant, $m_1, m_2$ = masses, $r$ = distance.  
- **In code**: Gravitational acceleration is calculated as  
  `a_grav = -G * mass * pos / r_safe**3`,  
  where `mass` is the central mass and `pos` is the particle's position vector.  

#### **Orbital Velocity**  
- Particles receive realistic initial orbital motion.  
- **Equation**:  
  $$
  v = \sqrt{\frac{G \cdot M}{r}}
  $$  
  where $v$ = orbital velocity, $M$ = central mass, $r$ = orbital radius.  
- **In code**:  
  `v_circ = np.sqrt(G * mass / radii)` computes this velocity for each particle.  

#### **Schwarzschild Radius (Event Horizon)**  
- Defines the event horizon's size, beyond which nothing escapes.  
- **Equation**:  
  $$
  R_s = \frac{2 \cdot G \cdot M}{c^2}
  $$  
  where $R_s$ = Schwarzschild radius, $c$ = speed of light.  
- **In code**:  
  `Rs = 2 * G * mass / c**2` calculates this radius, and a sphere of this size represents the event horizon.  

#### **Accretion**  
- Simplified model where particles within the event horizon are "absorbed," increasing the black hole's mass.  
- Captures the idea of black holes growing by consuming surrounding matter.

### Code Workflow  

#### **Initialization**  
- Define physical constants and simulation parameters.  
- Create random particle distribution around a central point (future black hole).  
- Assign initial velocities to simulate orbital motion.  

#### **Animation Loop**  
At each simulation step (per animation frame):  
1. Compute gravitational and friction forces on particles.  
2. Update particle velocities and positions using simple time integration.  
3. Identify particles crossing the event horizon (absorbed by the black hole).  
4. Increase the black hole's mass based on accreted particles.  
5. Update the plot to show new particle positions, event horizon size, and text data (mass, elapsed time).

### Limitations and Simplifications  
- **Newtonian Gravity**: Uses Newtonian gravity (sufficient for weak fields) instead of general relativity.  
- **No Relativistic Effects**: Excludes spacetime distortion, time dilation, and other relativistic phenomena.  
- **Simplified Accretion**: Ignores accretion disks, jets, and complex matter interactions.  
- **Artificial Friction**: Introduced to force particles toward the center, not fully realistic.  
- **Arbitrary Units**: No direct correspondence to real-world physical units.

# What Happens to Ordinary Matter Near a Black Hole ?

Near a black hole, ordinary matter undergoes extreme compression and intense forces, causing its temperature to rise significantly. This matter is drawn into a spiral at very high speeds, forming an accretion disk that orbits the black hole, sometimes close to the speed of light, especially if the black hole is rotating. During these rapid movements and particle collisions within the disk, an immense amount of energy is released, producing highly energetic radiation and accelerated particles. Part of this energy can escape into the universe as radiation.

Once matter crosses the event horizon, it can no longer escape. According to general relativity, it is inexorably pulled toward the central singularity, a region where density theoretically becomes infinite. This process leads to the destruction of the matter as it is absorbed by the black hole.

In summary, ordinary matter is first compressed and heated as it falls toward the black hole. It often forms an accretion disk, heated by gravitational forces and internal collisions, generating significant energy emission. After crossing the event horizon, matter is irreversibly drawn toward the singularity and disappears from the outside universe’s view. No identifiable ordinary matter remains outside the black hole after crossing the horizon, although the black hole may slowly emit weak energy in the form of Hawking radiation, a very subtle quantum phenomenon.

# What Happens to Dark Matter Near a Black Hole ?

Dark matter exhibits more complex behavior near black holes due to gravitational interactions and its still hypothetical properties. Recent research has highlighted several possible mechanisms. During galactic collisions, supermassive black holes may pass through regions with high concentrations of dark matter, creating so-called density "spikes." These zones may stabilize structures around black holes through self-interactions of dark matter particles. Unlike ordinary matter, dark matter is not directly absorbed by the black hole but influences its dynamic environment through gravity.

The hypothesis of self-interacting dark matter, where particles bounce among themselves, could resolve the "final parsec problem" by facilitating black hole mergers. This interaction would act as a "cosmic glue," keeping black holes close enough for their fusions.

Furthermore, certain models involving candidate dark matter particles such as axions predict a quantum effect called superradiance occurring near black holes, transferring energy to dark matter and generating detectable gravitational waves. These waves make spacetime vibrate like a bell.

Finally, if dark matter consists of primordial black holes, these could interact with supermassive black holes via tidal effects or merges, acting like invisible gravitational traps.

Thus, unlike ordinary matter, dark matter near black holes does not simply vanish but participates actively in spatial dynamics through stabilizing gravitational effects, exotic quantum interactions, or mechanisms that facilitate cosmic mergers. These processes help explain both supermassive black hole behavior and some observable signatures like gravitational waves.

# Behavior of Dark Matter Near a Black Hole

Although mysterious and not directly detectable, dark matter interacts gravitationally with black holes, enabling several theoretical scenarios to describe its behavior near such extreme objects. As it approaches a black hole, dark matter tends to accumulate around the event horizon, forming a dense cloud compared to its usual distribution in the universe. This accumulation results from the black hole’s intense gravitational field attracting dark matter like any other form of matter or energy.

In models where dark matter consists of specific particles such as axions, quantum effects like superradiance can occur. This phenomenon allows energy transfer from the black hole to dark matter, altering local dynamics and potentially slowing the black hole's rotation. This process generates emission of dark matter particles and detectable gravitational waves.

If dark matter has self-interaction properties, it may also act as a "cosmic glue," facilitating mergers of supermassive black holes by dissipating their orbital energy more efficiently than visible matter alone.

# Relevant Physical and Mathematical Equations

To model the dark matter density around a black hole, a "spike" density profile is often used:

$$
\rho(r) = \rho_0 \left( \frac{r}{r_0} \right)^{-\gamma}
$$

where $$\rho_0$$ is a reference density at distance $$r_0$$, $$r$$ is the distance from the black hole’s center, and $$\gamma$$ is a model-dependent parameter, typically around 2.25 for a classic spike.

The accretion rate of dark matter onto a black hole of mass $$M$$, for collisional particles, follows Bondi’s formula:

$$
\dot{M}_{\text{DM}} = 4\pi \lambda \frac{(G M)^2 \rho_{\infty}}{c_s^3}
$$

where $$\lambda$$ depends on the equation of state, $$\rho_{\infty}$$ is the dark matter density far from the black hole, and $$c_s$$ is the sound speed in the medium (very low for cold dark matter).

In the superradiance framework around a rotating Kerr black hole, the condition for amplification of a scalar field like axions is:

$$
\omega < m \Omega_H
$$

with $$\omega$$ the field frequency, $$m$$ the azimuthal quantum number, and $$\Omega_H$$ the angular velocity of the black hole’s horizon. The growth of the dark matter cloud is modeled by:

$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = 2 \Gamma N
$$

where $$N$$ is the particle number in the cloud and $$\Gamma$$ the superradiance instability rate.

The effect of self-interacting dark matter on the merger of supermassive black holes can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = - \nabla \Phi_{\text{tot}}
$$

where the total potential $$\Phi_{\text{tot}}$$ includes the classical gravitational potential $$\Phi_{\text{grav}}$$ plus an additional potential $$\Phi_{\text{DM}}$$ associated with dark matter modified by self-interactions.

# Difference in Attraction of a Black Hole on Ordinary Matter versus Dark Matter

A black hole’s gravitational attraction acts equally on both ordinary and dark matter, since it depends only on mass. However, the nature of their interactions differs significantly. Ordinary matter is subject, in addition to gravity, to electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, enabling atoms, stars, and energy dissipation via radiation, which facilitates efficient accretion onto black holes. Dark matter interacts primarily through gravity, and possibly very weakly via the weak force, making it invisible and insensitive to electromagnetic interactions. Consequently, while ordinary matter can form a compact, luminous accretion disk, dark matter typically falls “silently” into the black hole without emitting detectable radiation.

# Black Hole Evaporation and End of Life

Black holes evaporate via a quantum mechanism called Hawking radiation, gradually emitting particles and losing mass. For massive black holes, this effect is extremely slow. As the black hole loses mass, its temperature rises, accelerating evaporation. This intensifies dramatically when the mass becomes very small, ending with the black hole disappearing in a final explosive release of residual energy. This process can last extraordinarily long, far exceeding the current age of the universe, especially for stellar-mass black holes.

# Particles Emitted by a Black Hole at End of Life

During most of its existence, a black hole mainly emits light or massless particles such as photons, possibly gravitons, and neutrinos. At the end of its life, when its temperature becomes very high, it can also emit massive particles — electrons, positrons, muons, quarks, and potentially other elementary particles whose mass is less than the available thermal energy. This explosive emission marks the final phase of evaporation.

# Distinct Behavior of Dark Matter and Ordinary Matter Near a Black Hole

While dark matter can fall into a black hole, it behaves differently from ordinary matter because of its unique physical properties. Ordinary matter loses energy and angular momentum through collisions and electromagnetic interactions, easing collapse as it crosses the event horizon. In contrast, dark matter — electrically neutral and nearly non-interacting except gravitationally — preserves its angular momentum and often remains in stable orbit around the black hole. Consequently, dark matter forms a diffuse halo, with only a small fraction eventually absorbed.

Thus, although black holes mainly grow by accreting ordinary matter, in dark matter-rich environments, uncontrolled accretion of dark matter could potentially occur, since it is not limited by radiation pressure, unlike ordinary matter.

# Mathematical Equations Illustrating Differences Between Ordinary and Dark Matter Near a Black Hole

For a Schwarzschild black hole, the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is given by:

$$
r_{\mathrm{ISCO}} = \frac{6GM}{c^2}
$$

Only massive particles can maintain stable orbits at or beyond this radius. Ordinary matter loses energy and angular momentum through electromagnetic radiation and friction, allowing it to fall inside the ISCO down to the Schwarzschild radius

$$
R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}.
$$

Dark matter particles, however, follow geodesic equations exactly:

$$
\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d \tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \frac{dx^\alpha}{d \tau} \frac{dx^\beta}{d \tau} = 0,
$$

preserving their angular momentum and stabilizing orbits outside the ISCO. The radial effective potential governing motion is:

$$
V_{\mathrm{eff}}(r) = \left(1 - \frac{R_s}{r}\right) \left(1 + \frac{L^2}{r^2 c^2}\right).
$$

Ordinary matter decreases its angular momentum through interactions, permitting orbits inside the ISCO; dark matter maintains constant angular momentum.

The dark matter accretion rate into a black hole is roughly a thousand times less than that of ordinary matter due to lack of efficient dissipative processes.

# Mathematical Modeling of Gravitational Interaction of Dark Matter Around a Black Hole

Spacetime around a non-rotating black hole is described by the Schwarzschild metric:

$$
ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{R_s}{r}\right) c^2 dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{R_s}{r}\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta\, d\phi^2),
$$

with

$$
R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}.
$$

Dark matter particles follow geodesics given by:

$$
\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d \tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha \beta} \frac{d x^\alpha}{d \tau} \frac{d x^\beta}{d \tau} = 0,
$$

without dissipative terms. The dark matter density profile often resembles the NFW profile:

$$
\rho(r) = \frac{\rho_0}{\frac{r}{r_s} \left(1 + \frac{r}{r_s}\right)^2},
$$

which is modified near the black hole by tidal effects. Dark matter accretion rate remains low, approximately:

$$
\dot{M}_{\mathrm{DM}} \approx 10^{-3} \dot{M}_{\mathrm{baryonic}} \times \left(\frac{\rho_{\mathrm{DM}}}{0.1\, \mathrm{GeV/cm}^3}\right).
$$

# Relativity Equations Modeling This Interaction

The gravitational interaction between a black hole and dark matter is governed by Einstein’s field equations:

$$
G_{\mu \nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu \nu},
$$

where $$G_{\mu \nu}$$ is the Einstein tensor describing spacetime curvature and $$T_{\mu \nu}$$ is the stress-energy tensor of dark matter. Particle trajectories follow the geodesic equation:

$$
\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d \tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha \beta} \frac{d x^\alpha}{d \tau} \frac{d x^\beta}{d \tau} = 0,
$$

within the Schwarzschild (or Kerr for rotating black holes) metric. The orbital dynamics are analyzed using an effective potential:

$$
V_{\text{eff}}(r) = \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}\right) \left(1 + \frac{L^2}{r^2 c^2}\right).
$$

These equations enable precise modeling of dark matter gravitational dynamics near black holes without including other interactions.
