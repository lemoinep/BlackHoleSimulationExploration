My objective is to explore various concepts in physics by formulating problems mathematically and conducting simulations. 
This approach will yield many interesting and valuable insights.


## Detailed Explanations of the Code and Scientific Concepts  

### Why This Simulation?  
The primary goal is to provide a simplified yet instructive visualization of gravitational collapse and black hole formation. 
While not capturing the full complexity of general relativity, it offers an accessible representation of fundamental principles:  

- **Gravitational Collapse**: Understand how matter concentration contracts under its own gravity, becoming increasingly dense.  
- **Black Hole Formation**: Observe how this contraction creates an object so dense that even light cannot escape.  
- **Event Horizon**: Visualize the boundary (event horizon) beyond which nothing can return.  
- **Accretion**: Approximately simulate how black holes attract and absorb surrounding matter.
