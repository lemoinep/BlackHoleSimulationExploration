My objective is to explore various concepts in physics by formulating problems mathematically and conducting simulations.  
This approach will yield many interesting and valuable insights.

## Detailed Explanations of the Code and Scientific Concepts  

### Why This Simulation?  
The primary goal is to provide a simplified yet instructive visualization of gravitational collapse and black hole formation.  
While not capturing the full complexity of general relativity, it offers an accessible representation of fundamental principles:  

- **Gravitational Collapse**: Understand how matter concentration contracts under its own gravity, becoming increasingly dense.  
- **Black Hole Formation**: Observe how this contraction creates an object so dense that even light cannot escape.  
- **Event Horizon**: Visualize the boundary (event horizon) beyond which nothing can return.  
- **Accretion**: Approximately simulate how black holes attract and absorb surrounding matter.

### Key Concepts and Equations  

#### **Universal Gravitation (Newton)**  
- The simulation uses Newton's law to calculate gravitational forces between particles and the central mass (representing the forming black hole).  
- **Equation**:  
  $$
  F = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
  $$  
  where $F$ = force, $G$ = gravitational constant, $m_1, m_2$ = masses, $r$ = distance.  
- **In code**: Gravitational acceleration is calculated as  
  `a_grav = -G * mass * pos / r_safe**3`,  
  where `mass` is the central mass and `pos` is the particle's position vector.  

#### **Orbital Velocity**  
- Particles receive realistic initial orbital motion.  
- **Equation**:  
  $$
  v = \sqrt{\frac{G \cdot M}{r}}
  $$  
  where $v$ = orbital velocity, $M$ = central mass, $r$ = orbital radius.  
- **In code**:  
  `v_circ = np.sqrt(G * mass / radii)` computes this velocity for each particle.  

#### **Schwarzschild Radius (Event Horizon)**  
- Defines the event horizon's size, beyond which nothing escapes.  
- **Equation**:  
  $$
  R_s = \frac{2 \cdot G \cdot M}{c^2}
  $$  
  where $R_s$ = Schwarzschild radius, $c$ = speed of light.  
- **In code**:  
  `Rs = 2 * G * mass / c**2` calculates this radius, and a sphere of this size represents the event horizon.  

#### **Accretion**  
- Simplified model where particles within the event horizon are "absorbed," increasing the black hole's mass.  
- Captures the idea of black holes growing by consuming surrounding matter.

### Code Workflow  

#### **Initialization**  
- Define physical constants and simulation parameters.  
- Create random particle distribution around a central point (future black hole).  
- Assign initial velocities to simulate orbital motion.  

#### **Animation Loop**  
At each simulation step (per animation frame):  
1. Compute gravitational and friction forces on particles.  
2. Update particle velocities and positions using simple time integration.  
3. Identify particles crossing the event horizon (absorbed by the black hole).  
4. Increase the black hole's mass based on accreted particles.  
5. Update the plot to show new particle positions, event horizon size, and text data (mass, elapsed time).

### Limitations and Simplifications  
- **Newtonian Gravity**: Uses Newtonian gravity (sufficient for weak fields) instead of general relativity.  
- **No Relativistic Effects**: Excludes spacetime distortion, time dilation, and other relativistic phenomena.  
- **Simplified Accretion**: Ignores accretion disks, jets, and complex matter interactions.  
- **Artificial Friction**: Introduced to force particles toward the center, not fully realistic.  
- **Arbitrary Units**: No direct correspondence to real-world physical units.

### Project descriptions 

This project simulates the visual and physical effects of a non-spinning (Schwarzschild) black hole on light and background images by numerically solving photon geodesic equations. The programs distort input images to represent how a black hole bends light, enabling visualization of gravitational lensing and event horizon effects. Users can generate animations, explore different black hole parameters, and save simulation data for further analysis. This toolkit serves as an educational and research resource for understanding black hole optics and general relativity phenomena through computational simulation.
