= Mathematical Comparison: Normal Matter vs. Dark Matter Near a Black Hole

== Black Hole Metric Reminder

The geometry of spacetime around a Schwarzschild black hole (non-rotating, uncharged) is given by:

[latexmath]
++++
ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}\right)c^2 dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\, d\phi^2)
++++

where:
- [latexmath]++G++ = gravitational constant
- [latexmath]++M++ = black hole mass
- [latexmath]++c++ = speed of light
- [latexmath]++r++ = radial distance from the black hole center

The Schwarzschild radius (event horizon):

[latexmath]
++++
r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}
++++

== Normal Matter Near a Black Hole

*Normal (baryonic) matter* follows the geodesics of this metric:
- Outside ([latexmath]++r > r_s++), particles and light can orbit or fall into the black hole.
- Inside ([latexmath]++r < r_s++), all trajectories inevitably lead to the singularity.

For a photon (normal matter, massless), the geodesic condition is:

[latexmath]
++++
ds^2 = 0
++++

In radial coordinates ([latexmath]++d\theta = d\phi = 0++), this gives:

[latexmath]
++++
0 = -\left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right)c^2 dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right)^{-1} dr^2
++++

== Dark Matter Near a Black Hole

Dark matter, though its nature is unknown, is generally modeled as a massive particle or collisionless fluid, interacting only gravitationally.
- It also follows the geodesics of the Schwarzschild metric, but does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation.

The equation of motion for a massive particle (normal or dark matter):

[latexmath]
++++
ds^2 = -c^2 d\tau^2
++++

where [latexmath]++d\tau++ is the particle's proper time.

Thus, the gravitational behavior of dark matter and normal matter is identical near a black hole, since both follow the same Schwarzschild metric.

== Bimetric Models and Alternatives

Some advanced cosmological models (bimetric) propose that dark matter could evolve on a different "sheet" of spacetime, with a different metric:

- For normal matter:
+
[latexmath]
++++
ds_{(1)}^2 = g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu
++++

- For dark matter (hypothetical):
+
[latexmath]
++++
ds_{(2)}^2 = \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu
++++

In such models, dark matter could have a different speed limit ([latexmath]++\tilde{c}++), but no observation has confirmed this to date.

|===
|Type of Matter |Geodesic Equation |Main Interaction |Behavior Near Black Hole

|Normal matter
|[latexmath]++ds^2 = -c^2 d\tau^2++
|Gravity, electromagnetic
|Falls to singularity, possible radiation

|Dark matter
|[latexmath]++ds^2 = -c^2 d\tau^2++
|Gravity only
|Falls to singularity, no radiation
|===

In standard models, normal and dark matter are indistinguishable gravitationally near a black hole, as both follow the same equations of general relativity. Alternative models propose a different metric for dark matter, but this remains speculative.
